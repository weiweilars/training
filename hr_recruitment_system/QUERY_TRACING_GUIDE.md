# HR System Query Tracing Guide

This guide shows you how to use the **fixed and enhanced** query tracing scripts to monitor and debug your HR recruitment system's agent interactions, tool calls, and execution flow.

## ‚úÖ Recent Fixes Applied

Both query scripts have been **fixed and enhanced**:
- ‚úÖ **JSON-RPC Method Fixed**: Changed from incorrect `"process_message"` to correct `"message/send"`
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Readability**: Full response content display (800 chars vs 100)
- ‚úÖ **Better Formatting**: Clear `‚úÖ Main Query Response:` labels for important results
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Team Coordination**: Proven to work across all team boundaries

## Overview

The HR recruitment system has multiple layers of agents working in **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** coordination:
- **Individual Agents** (ports 5020-5030): Job requisition, sourcing, screening, etc.
- **Team Coordinators** (ports 5032-5034): Acquisition, experience, closing teams
- **Master Coordinator** (port 5040): Orchestrates everything with intelligent delegation
- **Tool Servers** (ports 8051-8143): 28 MCP tools for specialized HR operations

## Scripts Available

### 1. `query_master_agent.py` - Basic Query Client ‚úÖ FIXED
Simple, fast script for sending queries and capturing responses with colored logging.

### 2. `advanced_query_tracer.py` - Full System Tracer ‚úÖ FIXED & ENHANCED
Advanced script that captures all HTTP traffic, agent calls, tool invocations, and multi-team coordination patterns.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Setup Environment
```bash
cd hr_recruitment_system

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required dependencies
pip install semantic-kernel aiohttp requests colorama websockets
```

### Step 2: Start the System (Correct Order)
```bash
# 1. Start all MCP tool servers (Level 1 - Foundation)
./start_tools.sh --start-all

# 2. Start all individual agents (Level 2 - Specialists)
./start_agents.sh --all

# 3. Start team coordinators (Level 3 - Orchestration)
./start_coordinators.sh --all

# 4. Check system status
./status.sh
```

### Step 3: Run Queries with Tracing

#### Basic Query Logging
```bash
# Single query
python query_master_agent.py "Create a job posting for a Senior Python Developer"

# Interactive mode
python query_master_agent.py --interactive
```

#### Advanced Tracing
```bash
# Single query with full tracing
python advanced_query_tracer.py "Create a job posting for a Senior Python Developer"

# Interactive mode with custom trace duration
python advanced_query_tracer.py --interactive --trace-duration 60

# Save trace to specific file
python advanced_query_tracer.py "Complex hiring workflow" --output my_trace.json
```

## üéØ Sample Queries to Test Different Coordination Patterns

## üìä Understanding the Enhanced Output

### ‚úÖ Improved Readability Features
- **Enhanced Response Display**: Main query responses show full content (800 chars vs 100)
- **Clear Visual Indicators**: `‚úÖ Main Query Response:` labels for important results
- **Better Content Extraction**: Shows actual job postings and coordination messages instead of JSON noise
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Focuses on meaningful events while preserving trace completeness

### Color Coding
- **üîµ Blue**: HTTP requests
- **üü¢ Green**: HTTP responses (success) + Main query response labels
- **üî¥ Red**: Errors
- **üü£ Magenta**: Agent calls
- **üü° Yellow**: Tool calls
- **‚ö´ Gray**: System events and monitoring

### Trace Event Types
- `HTTP_REQUEST`: Request sent to an agent
- `HTTP_RESPONSE`: Response received from an agent (now with enhanced content display)
- `AGENT_CALL`: One agent calling another
- `TOOL_CALL`: Agent using an MCP tool
- `AGENT_STATUS`: Health check results (minimized for readability)
- `LOG_MONITORING_START`: System monitoring initiation

### Key Information Captured
1. **Multi-Team Coordination**: See explicit delegation to specific team agents (5032, 5033, 5034)
2. **Agent Interaction Sequence**: Which agents were called in order
3. **Workflow Dependencies**: How teams hand off tasks to each other
4. **Tool Usage**: What tools were invoked and by whom
5. **Timing**: How long each operation took (especially useful for 5-10 second responses)
6. **Readable Content**: Actual job postings, coordination messages, and results
7. **Errors**: Any failures in the chain

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ‚úÖ FIXED: "Method not found: process_message" Error
**Problem**: `{"code": -32601, "message": "Method not found: process_message"}`
**Solution**: Both scripts have been fixed to use the correct `"message/send"` method.

### Virtual Environment Setup
```bash
# Create venv if not exists
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all required dependencies
pip install semantic-kernel aiohttp requests colorama websockets
```

### Agents Not Responding
```bash
# Check if agents are running
./status.sh

# Clean up and restart in correct order
./cleanup.sh all
./start_tools.sh --start-all
./start_agents.sh --all
./start_coordinators.sh --all
```

### Connection Refused Errors
- ‚úÖ **Ensure proper startup order**: Tools ‚Üí Individual Agents ‚Üí Team Coordinators
- ‚úÖ **Check virtual environment**: Make sure `source venv/bin/activate` is run
- ‚úÖ **Verify ports**: Use `./status.sh` to check which services are running
- ‚úÖ **Wait for startup**: Allow 5-10 seconds between each startup step

### "Master agent not available" Error
```bash
# Verify master coordinator is running
curl http://localhost:5040/.well-known/agent-card.json

# If not running, restart coordinators
./start_coordinators.sh --all
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Master URL
```bash
python advanced_query_tracer.py "query" --master-url http://localhost:5040
```

### Extended Tracing Duration
```bash
python advanced_query_tracer.py "complex query" --trace-duration 120
```

### Automatic Trace Organization ‚úÖ NEW
```bash
# All traces are automatically saved to traces/ directory
python advanced_query_tracer.py "query"  # Automatically saves to traces/trace_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json

# Custom output location (still within traces/)
python advanced_query_tracer.py "query" --output traces/custom_trace.json

# Manual timestamp naming
python advanced_query_tracer.py "query" --output traces/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json
```

## Sample Output Analysis

When you run a query, you'll see output like:
```
[14:30:15.123] HTTP_REQUEST CLIENT ‚Üí MASTER_COORDINATOR POST /chat
    Payload: {"message": "Create job posting...", "conversation_id": "trace_..."}

[14:30:15.145] HTTP_RESPONSE MASTER_COORDINATOR ‚Üí CLIENT 200 (22.5ms)
    Response: {"status": "processing", "workflow_id": "..."}

[14:30:15.150] HTTP_REQUEST MASTER_COORDINATOR ‚Üí ACQUISITION_TEAM POST /delegate
    Payload: {"task": "job_creation", "details": {...}}

[14:30:15.180] HTTP_REQUEST ACQUISITION_TEAM ‚Üí JOB_REQUISITION POST /create_job
    Payload: {"title": "Senior Python Developer", ...}

[14:30:15.200] HTTP_REQUEST JOB_REQUISITION ‚Üí TOOL_SERVER_1 POST /mcp
    Payload: {"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "create_job_draft"}}
```

This shows:
1. Query sent to master coordinator
2. Master delegates to acquisition team
3. Acquisition team calls job requisition agent
4. Job requisition agent uses MCP tool

## Files Generated

### Trace Files (Automatically Organized) ‚úÖ NEW
All trace files are automatically saved in the `traces/` directory:
- `traces/trace_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`: Full trace data
- `traces/trace_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_summary.json`: Execution summary
- The `traces/` directory is automatically created if it doesn't exist
- All trace files are excluded from git via `.gitignore`

### Log Files
- Individual agent logs (if configured)
- System health checks
- Error logs

## Performance Tips

1. **Start with shorter traces** (30s) for quick debugging
2. **Use specific queries** to test particular agent paths
3. **Save traces** for complex scenarios to analyze later
4. **Compare traces** before/after changes to see differences

## Integration with Development

### Debug Workflow
1. Run trace on failing query
2. Identify where the chain breaks
3. Check specific agent logs
4. Fix issue and re-trace
5. Compare before/after traces

### Performance Analysis
1. Look for slow HTTP responses (>1000ms)
2. Identify bottleneck agents
3. Check tool call frequencies
4. Optimize based on patterns

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Job Creation Not Working
```bash
# Trace the creation process
python advanced_query_tracer.py "Create a Software Engineer position"

# Look for:
# - Did master coordinator receive the query?
# - Which team did it delegate to?
# - Did the team call the right individual agent?
# - Were the tool calls successful?
```

### Scenario 2: Slow Response Times
```bash
# Run with extended monitoring
python advanced_query_tracer.py "Complex hiring workflow" --trace-duration 90

# Check summary for:
# - Total execution time
# - Individual request durations
# - Number of agent hops
# - Tool call overhead
```

### Scenario 3: Missing Agent Interactions
```bash
# Use interactive mode to test step by step
python advanced_query_tracer.py --interactive

# Try queries like:
# "Test acquisition team"
# "Test experience team"
# "Test closing team"
# "Test master coordination"
```

## üöÄ Enhanced A2A Multi-Team Coordination Features

### ‚úÖ What's New and Fixed

#### **Fixed Scripts**
- ‚úÖ **JSON-RPC Method**: Corrected `"process_message"` ‚Üí `"message/send"`
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Readability**: 800-character response display vs 100
- ‚úÖ **Clear Visual Indicators**: `‚úÖ Main Query Response:` for important results
- ‚úÖ **Better Content Extraction**: Shows actual coordination messages and job postings

#### **Multi-Team Coordination Proven**
- ‚úÖ **Master Coordinator** (5040) ‚Üí Intelligent task delegation
- ‚úÖ **Acquisition Team** (5032) ‚Üí Job creation, sourcing, screening
- ‚úÖ **Experience Team** (5033) ‚Üí Interviews, assessments, communication
- ‚úÖ **Closing Team** (5034) ‚Üí Offers, negotiations, compliance

### üéØ Key Coordination Patterns

1. **Sequential Workflows**: Acquisition ‚Üí Experience ‚Üí Closing
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple teams working simultaneously
3. **Dependency Management**: Teams waiting for handoffs from other teams
4. **Intelligent Delegation**: Master coordinator choosing appropriate teams

### üìä Sample Output Quality

**Before Fix**:
```
Response: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "trace_175796852", "result": {"taskId": "560bf149-2eb6"...
```

**After Enhancement**:
```
‚úÖ Main Query Response:
Alright, I will coordinate activities with the respective team agents...

### **Acquisition Team Agent (5032)**,
Please screen the 25 applications we have received for the DevOps Engineer position.

### **Experience Team Agent (5033)**,
Once the Acquisition Team provides the list of the top 8 candidates...

### **Closing Team Agent (5034)**,
Please prepare competitive salary offers for the top 2 candidates...
```
